                        OrganizeVC is a space reservation system that allows you to book various rooms on Vassarâ€™s campus
                        for events. Rather than hunting for a free space by blundering through Rocky interrupting lectures
                        or walking in on film screenings, OrganizeVC allows you to reserve a room in advance or even on
                        the day of. You can reserve rooms for several hours at time, and also view reservation history
                        for any given date.

                        With OrganizeVC, you can now ensure your org, performance, a cappella group, study session, or
                        impromptu drum circle has the appropriate space!
